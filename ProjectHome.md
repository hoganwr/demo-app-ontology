The demographics application ontology is an application ontology with key representational units necessary for collecting, handling, displaying, etc. data that typically falls under the heading 'demographics'.  For example, it has terms for gender, sex, marital status, etc.

As an application ontology, it only imports representations of universals, it does not create any new ones.  The only new content it adds is various attributive collections (previously known as "defined classes") that are collections of particulars that are not extensions of universals.

For example, it imports sex terms from PATO, gender and marital status terms from the Ontology of Medically Related Social Entities, birth event from the ACGT ontology, and human being from the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations.
